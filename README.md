# CloudStorageFinder
In 2011 I released my [Bucket Finder](https://digi.ninja/blog/whats_in_amazons_buckets.php) project, this was well before hunting S3 Buckets was popular and I only wrote it for something to do on a weekend. The tool then lay untouched by me for seven years and I honestly thought that it would be dead by now, the API would have moved on and code I wrote would be obsolete, that was till the end of 2017 when, for about the third time, Buckets got sexy again and people started to get in touch to tell me they were using my tool and that it was really useful, the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42839462) even used it in an article. So I dug it out and found, to my surprise, that it did still work.

As well as a tool for scraping Amazon Buckets, I also wrote a couple of other tools which didn't get much attention at the time but will probably be quite useful to some people given the current trends for searching for content in cloud storage providers. Rather than try to promote each individual one, I've decided to put them all together into a single repository called The Cloud Storage Finder Project so that people can branch out and find content on systems other than Amazon. I've also added a new tool for searching Digital Ocean Spaces which are just like S3 Buckets, just by a different provider.

For now, all I've done is small tweaks to make sure everything works but I have plans to add new features, if there is anything you'd like to see, please raise a ticket and I'll see what I can do. I've also got some ideas for other services I can scrape but that will come later, when I have some spare time to do the research.

* ![New!](https://digi.ninja/graphics/new_icon.png "New!") DigitalOcean Space Finder - DO use the same XML format for their Spaces as Amazon S3 so this script is a small rewrite of the original Bucket Finder script.
* Amazon Bucket Finder - The original Amazon S3 Bucket Finder script. [More info](https://digi.ninja/projects/bucket_finder.php)
* SpiderOak Finder - Searches SpiderOak for open shared folders. SpiderOak shares are public by default but can be protected by password. When brute forcing you have to find the account name and then the folder name hence the need for two input files. [More info](https://digi.ninja/projects/spidering_spideroak.php)
* Me Finder - This searched the now discontinued Mobile Me system, the script, obviously, no longer works, but I've included it for historical reference. [More info](https://digi.ninja/projects/me_finder.php)
